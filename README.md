### Mitigating Occupational Stereotypes in Image Search with Artificial Creativity
Academic research has proven that image searches produce results with inherent biases that correlate with the data available to the model rather than representing the real-world representation of that subject. There have been attempts to mitigate this bias, but now large language models can take complicated queries and produce creative results.  
  
It is now possible to use these models to take simple queries and, by leveraging prompt engineering, produce more diverse and imaginative results than the original subject prompt.  
  
This repository shows how the GPT3 natural language processing model can be integrated with the text-to-image model Dall-e 2 to produce diverse and creative results for a given subject. This workflow could be implemented in Google image search or other image searching services to give higher quality, more diverse, and more representative results.
